# Family-Services-HR-Analytics-Project

### I worked as an data analytics intern at Family Services from January 2018 to May 2018.
### There were two major questions I tried to tackle:
#### (1) Determining which factors are most influential in employees' decision to quit their jobs
#### (2) Classifying employees to high risk, medium risk, and low risk depending on their potential risk of quitting work using predictive machine learning models. After my project, the HR manager was able to specifically target the high risk employees and concentrate his resources(e.g. 1:1 consulation, potential pay raise etc.) towards them.
